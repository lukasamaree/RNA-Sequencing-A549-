# RNA-Sequencing-A549-

I analyzed a single cell RNA sequence dataset of Lung Carcinoma cells (A549). I cleaned data removing noise using violin plots. I used PCA analysis and used the top ten principle components to get the data with the most variance. I then used UMAP to create clusters of the genes through their gene expression. With feature plots and violin plots I was able to connect the gene expressions of the cells clusters to actual cells in the lungs. I was also able to map which cells reacted under certain signiling pathways.
